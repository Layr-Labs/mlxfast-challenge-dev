# Emit a REDACTED failure record for a failed benchmark job, safe for public
# artifact upload.
#
# A failing score.json must never be uploaded raw: its free-text error and
# first_failing/expected/actual token fields can carry hidden-golden token
# values, and errors thrown inside the sandboxed worker can carry arbitrary
# submitted-code-controlled text (an exfiltration channel for anything the
# model code observed). Until now the failing score.json simply died with the
# ephemeral runner, so a floor failure, a decode-oracle token mismatch, and a
# harness crash all surfaced identically as "benchmark_failed" with no way to
# tell them apart afterwards.
#
# This trusted script closes that observability gap by deriving only:
#   - a failure CATEGORY matched against harness-authored error prefixes,
#   - harness-authored booleans (passed flags, partial_result),
#   - already-coarsened wall seconds,
#   - the first failing decode step floored to a coarse bucket of 32.
# The raw error string is never printed, uploaded, or partially quoted.
