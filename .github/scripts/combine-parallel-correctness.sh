#   machine1/ - ran `mlxfast-swift benchmark` with MLXFAST_BENCHMARK_CORRECTNESS_STEPS=0
#               (GPQA cases + GPQA TTFT + timed prefill/decode; skips its own base
#               teacher-forced correctness case)
#   machine2/ .. machineN/ - each ran `mlxfast-swift correctness --base-case-only
#               --step-range START-END --step-range-output step-range.json`, covering a
#               disjoint slice of the base correctness case's step window. --base-case-only
#               is required: without it, checked_steps also includes anchors/free-run/
#               behavior/GPQA from the golden file, which is not comparable across
#               machines and would corrupt the coverage check below.
#
# This script is the only place the real, combined correctness verdict is asserted.
# Machine 1's own score.json reports passed_correctness based on nothing but GPQA/TTFT/
# floor checks -- it must never be published as-is. This script ANDs in the base-case
# verdict from every correctness-only machine before anything gets staged or uploaded.
