# MLXFast Challenge Agent Guide

This repository is the Swift-only Gemma 4 31B 4-bit dense inference
optimization challenge.
Use this file as the working contract for coding agents and participants.

## Goal

Optimize Gemma 4 31B 4-bit (text tower only) inference on Apple Silicon without
changing the observable model behavior required by the correctness gates.

The official score rewards faster prefill and decode:

```text
decode_speedup = baseline_decode_sec_per_token / decode_sec_per_token
prefill_speedup = baseline_prefill_sec_per_token / prefill_sec_per_token
score = decode_speedup^0.75 * prefill_speedup^0.25
```

Higher is better. Baseline is about `1.0` on the official runner. Decode is
weighted more heavily because it dominates interactive generation. Both decode
and prefill must also stay within the configured 0.95 speedup floors.

## Official Hardware

Ranked benchmark runs execute through GitHub Actions on tenki-hosted Apple
Silicon runners. The runner label configured in the ranked workflows under
`.github/` is the source of truth; today that is:

```text
tenki-macos-latest-xlarge
```

The ranked hardware contract for this benchmark is Apple M4-generation
silicon with at least 36 GB of unified memory; the official baseline
constants were calibrated on fresh tenki VMs of that runner class (see
`Sources/MLXFastCore/Constants.swift`). Gemma 4 31B 4-bit is a dense model: the text
tower is about 17 GB in 4-bit, so it is fully RAM-resident under that
contract: the runtime loads every text-tower tensor once during untimed
initialization and keeps it resident for the whole process lifetime. There is
no weight streaming of any kind, no expert cache, and no disk I/O on the
scored prefill/decode path. Optimization effort should go into compute —
attention kernels (sliding-window vs. full-attention dispatch, GQA,
partial-rotary RoPE), quantized matmul dispatch, KV-cache handling, memory
layout, and MLX scheduling — not disk I/O.

Local machines need enough unified memory to hold the ~17 GB text tower plus
KV cache and activation buffers; the 36 GB contract minimum is a practical
local minimum too. A kernel or layout strategy that helps on one Apple Silicon
generation can move differently on the official runner, so always rely on the
official benchmark for ranking.

## What You May Optimize

The submitted editable surface is defined in `benchmark.json`:

```text
Sources/MLXFastModel/
Sources/MLXFastTransform/
```

Focus on:

- Reducing scored prefill and decode seconds per token.
- Optimizing kernels and hot-path MLX operations used by attention (both the
 sliding-window and full-attention layer types), the gated MLP, KV-cache
 handling, and dense weight materialization.
- Reducing model execution work on the hot path: MLX ops, synchronization,
 materialization, copies, and cache misses.
- Improving how RAM-resident dense weight bytes become MLXArrays (quantized
 linear construction, fewer copies, lazier Data-to-Metal conversions).
- Making the offline transform produce better runtime metadata or compact
 transformed artifacts.
- Improving prefill and decode execution inside the Swift/MLX model path.

The model is Gemma 4 31B, dense, 4-bit, text tower only (vision/audio are out
of scope and are never loaded). The frozen reference checkpoint is about
18.4 GB across 4 safetensors shards. `setup.sh` stores it in a repo-local
Hugging Face-style cache by default and verifies it against the pinned
manifest. The transformed `weights/` tree holds only the text-tower tensors
(everything under the source checkpoint's `language_model.` prefix) plus a
runtime-authored `config.json`; it is an overlay/runtime artifact, not a
second full copy of the model. Aim to keep generated transformed weights under
20 GB (the default cap is 25 GiB).

## What Not To Change

Do not spend time modifying files outside `editablePaths` for a submission.
They are trusted harness/operator code and are not packaged by submit:

- `Sources/MLXFastCore/`
- `Sources/MLXFastHarness/`
- `Sources/MLXFastCLI/`
- `.github/`, scripts, tests, docs, `benchmark.json`
- `weights/`, reference checkpoints, scores, golden files, local caches

Do not try to hardcode hidden prompts, hidden token IDs, GPQA answers, timing
shortcuts, protocol injection, network access, or filesystem exfiltration. The
official runner uses private artifacts, sandboxed runtime workers, artifact
validation, trusted workflow code, and static review gates. Hidden prompts and
goldens are not part of the public repo or submission payload.

Python is not part of the challenge runtime. Setup, transform, correctness, and
benchmark run through the Swift package. Account login, clone, and submission
use the Yukon CLI (`mlxfast`).

## Correctness Gates

Correctness is a hard gate. Passing locally is necessary but not sufficient for
ranking.

The public local gate uses checked-in prompt/golden fixtures under
`correctness_prompts/`. These fixtures are Gemma-generated: the prompt text is
tokenized with the Gemma 4 tokenizer and the expected tokens are greedy
continuations captured from the Gemma 4 31B 4-bit reference implementation
(`mlxfast-swift generate-golden`); see `TASK.md`. The official benchmark uses
private artifacts supplied by the organizer, which must likewise be
regenerated for Gemma 4 before ranked scoring.

The official correctness stack includes:

- Teacher-forced token checks on 512-token prompt cases.
- Hidden behavior checks, including GPQA-style prompts.
- Short exact-token GPQA prefix checks from the private reference fixture.
- Semantic GPQA judging through a private judge path.
- TTFT guardrails for hidden GPQA first-token behavior.
- Benchmark oracle checks for the timed prefill/decode prompt.

The source of truth for current token counts and baseline constants is
`Sources/MLXFastCore/Constants.swift`.

## Timing And Score Measurement

The official benchmark measures:

- Prefill seconds per token.
- Decode seconds per token.
- Weighted score from prefill and decode speedups.
- Pass/fail component speed floors.

Diagnostic fields such as memory and read timings are recorded for audit and
future guardrails, but are not the primary score unless the benchmark contract
changes. There is no expert/weight-streaming bandwidth to report for this
dense model: `bandwidth_gb_per_token` is always `0` with
`bandwidth_source=ram_resident_model`. Do not optimize for that diagnostic
field as a standalone target; optimize changes that reduce the measured
prefill and decode timings.

The benchmark charges decode setup to the decode measurement so model code
cannot hide future-token work in an unscored seed-prefill phase.

## Local Workflow

Before optimizing, sync to the latest challenge tip and record a same-machine
local baseline. Do not compare your changes against a stale branch or an old
local run:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
./setup.sh
./benchmark.sh --local-iterate
cp score.local-iterate.json score.local-iterate.baseline.json
```

Create your working branch from that synced commit, or rebase/merge your
existing branch onto `origin/main` before trusting local timings. Every
`./benchmark.sh --local-iterate` result should be interpreted as performance on
top of the latest synced base commit measured on the same local machine, with
the same toolchain, model cache, power state, and thermal conditions. If the
base commit changes, rerun the local baseline before deciding whether an
optimization is faster.

Start with:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This checks the local Swift/Xcode toolchain, builds the Swift harness and MLX
Metal library, downloads or verifies the Gemma 4 31B 4-bit reference
checkpoint, and prepares the local cache. If the repo disk is too small, put the
reference cache on a larger volume and set `MLXFAST_REFERENCE_CACHE_DIR` or
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR`.

Common commands:

```bash
swift test
MLXFAST_RUN_MLX_RUNTIME_TESTS=1 swift test
swift build -c release
.build/release/mlxfast-swift transform --output weights
.build/release/mlxfast-swift correctness --weights weights
./benchmark.sh --local-iterate
./benchmark.sh --local-submit
./benchmark.sh --official
```

`./benchmark.sh --local-iterate` is the fast local edit-loop signal.
Use it to compare the current working tree against the latest-tip baseline you
recorded above, not against a result from an older branch.
`./benchmark.sh --local-submit` is the Yukon pre-submit gate and is intended to
be longer and closer to the official path while still producing `score: null`.
`./benchmark.sh --official` is the full ranked entrypoint and requires the
hidden golden artifacts provisioned on the official runner. A bare
`./benchmark.sh` defaults to `--local-iterate`.

## Swift Tooling

Use the Swift toolchain that `./setup.sh` validates. `sourcekit-lsp` is the
standard Swift language server and is usually installed with Xcode or the Swift
toolchain. Point your editor at the repository root so SourceKit-LSP can read
`Package.swift` and resolve the SwiftPM targets.

Useful local tooling commands:

```bash
swift package resolve
swift build -c release
swift test
sourcekit-lsp
xcode-select -p
xcrun --find sourcekit-lsp
```

For editor agents, prefer SourceKit-LSP symbol navigation and diagnostics over
string-only edits when changing Swift model code. Use `swift test` for cheap
contract checks, and use `MLXFAST_RUN_MLX_RUNTIME_TESTS=1 swift test` when a
change touches MLX runtime behavior and the machine can run those tests.

## Submission Workflow

Use Yukon/Darkbloom submit commands through the Yukon CLI:

```bash
mlxfast login <api-key> --api <url>
mlxfast clone <benchmark-id-or-name>
mlxfast submit --model "<model name>" --note "describe optimization"
mlxfast submissions
```

Submit packages only `editablePaths`. It rejects generated artifacts, symlinks,
local scores, reference checkpoints, and source changes outside the editable
surface. Live submit first runs the configured local pre-submit benchmark, then
uploads the editable-path archive for official validation.

## Practical Optimization Ideas

Good submissions are likely to improve one or more of:

- Attention kernel dispatch: sliding-window vs. full-attention masking, GQA
 head-group broadcasting, and the full-attention layers' partial-rotary
 ("proportional") RoPE.
- Quantized matmul dispatch for the affine 4-bit (group size 64) dense
 projections: fewer dequantize/copy steps, better batching across the gated
 MLP's `gate_proj`/`up_proj`, and reuse of derived weight views.
- KV cache handling: the sliding-window cache only ever needs the last 1024
 positions; a tighter ring-buffer implementation can reduce both memory and
 copy overhead relative to the straightforward baseline.
- Dense weight loading and reuse: eager preparation at init, warm kernels
 before the first scored forward, and avoiding redundant Data-to-Metal
 conversions.
- MLX operation scheduling and synchronization.
- Transform metadata that lets runtime skip work safely.

Be careful with optimizations that only help a single public prompt or a single
machine. The hidden correctness and benchmark prompts are different from the
public local fixtures, and official scoring happens on the tenki runner.

## Avoid These Wrong Strategies

Do not assume the benchmark machine has the same memory budget as your local
Mac. The official contract is Apple M4-generation silicon with at least 36 GB
of unified memory (today's runner: tenki-macos-latest-xlarge); the ~17 GB text
tower is comfortably RAM-resident there, but headroom for KV cache, buffers,
and caches is finite — do not tune memory-hungry strategies against a larger
local machine. Unlike a large MoE checkpoint there is no meaningfully
different "streaming fallback" regime here to mistune against.

Do not specialize for the public correctness prompt. Optimizations should be
prompt-independent and model-general for Gemma 4. Hidden correctness, GPQA,
and benchmark prompts are different from the public fixtures.

Do not add caches or memos keyed on a request's input tokens whose only
possible hit is the benchmark harness repeating an identical computation — for
example, memoizing a whole-prompt forward's logits or KV state so a repeated
identical forward can skip the work. Bit-identical output does not make this
legitimate. The benchmark measures single-pass inference: optimizations must
save work that recurs in single-pass production inference (one prefill, then
decode, per prompt), not work that only exists in the measurement protocol.
The harness never legitimately issues the same whole-prompt forward twice to
one worker process; any such repetition is a harness bug, never a contract to
rely on. Input-independent caching (weights, dequantized tensors, RoPE/mask
tables keyed on shapes and offsets) and within-request KV reuse remain fine.
Submissions in this category fail the static review as bypass behavior.

Do not treat local-only environment overrides as proof of a valid improvement.
Examples include disabling the sandbox, skipping transform without verifying
the produced `weights/`, pointing at a user-specific reference path, or tuning
with settings that are not part of the official benchmark contract. Those can
be useful for debugging one machine, but they do not establish a rankable
optimization.

Do not draw conclusions from a tiny local iterate run alone. Short local modes
are smoke tests for speed and correctness direction. They are not substitutes
for the official hidden benchmark, and they are especially weak for testing
sequence-length-dependent optimizations (e.g. attention kernel changes) since
they may not exercise the same sequence lengths or memory pressure as the
ranked run.

## Before Submitting

Run at least:

```bash
swift test
./setup.sh
.build/release/mlxfast-swift correctness --weights weights
./benchmark.sh --local-submit
```

If the local correctness gate fails, the official benchmark will not rank the
submission. If local performance improves but correctness is fragile, prefer a
more conservative optimization.
