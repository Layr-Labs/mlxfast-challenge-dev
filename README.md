# mlxfast — DeepSeek V4 Flash

A benchmark arena for memory-bandwidth-optimal LLM inference on Apple Silicon.
Run DeepSeek V4 Flash without loading all 256 experts into RAM — and beat the baseline score.

See [CHALLENGE.md](CHALLENGE.md) for the full problem statement, scoring formula, and approach space.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Check local tools, build the Swift harness/MLX metallib, and fetch weights if needed
./setup.sh

# Optional: split dense weights into weights/ and write the expert streaming
# manifest. setup.sh prints this command with the exact reference path it used.
MLXFAST_OFFLINE_WRITABLE_PATHS="${PWD}/weights" \
  .github/scripts/run-offline.sh .build/release/mlxfast-swift transform \
  --reference .cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit/snapshots/main \
  --output weights

# Run the checked-in public correctness gate.
.build/release/mlxfast-swift correctness --weights weights

# Fast edit-loop signal: uses the public 512-token correctness prompt, checks
# the prefill next token plus 16 teacher-forced decode tokens, writes
# score.local-iterate.json, and prints it to stdout.
./benchmark.sh --local-iterate

# Run the Darkbloom-compatible benchmark entrypoint.
# Official benchmark runs use the organizer-supplied hidden correctness_golden.json.
./benchmark.sh

# Local submit check used by Yukon before upload: runs the public 512-token
# prompt through a longer checked timing window, writes score.json with
# score: null, and prints it to stdout.
./benchmark.sh --local-submit

# Or call the Swift CLI directly
.build/release/mlxfast-swift correctness --weights weights
.build/release/mlxfast-swift preflight
.build/release/mlxfast-swift benchmark --local-iterate
.build/release/mlxfast-swift benchmark --score-path score.json
.build/release/mlxfast-swift benchmark --local-submit --score-path score.json

# If required model artifacts are missing, the benchmark emits a valid failed
# score.json instead of a ranked score.
```

The benchmark writes `score.json` in the format consumed by Darkbloom.
`score.json` is a generated local output and is not tracked. Public
correctness-only workflow runs use the checked-in
`correctness_prompts/public_longcopy_gate_english_512_256.json` golden and
matching prompt text. Official benchmark runs use a hidden
`correctness_golden.json` supplied by the benchmark operator, or a harness path
set with `MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH=/path/to/correctness_golden.json`.
`benchmark.sh` also writes `score.json.sha256` and `benchmark-integrity.json`,
which record the score file hash, golden hash, transformed `weights/` hash, and
transform source hash for run auditing.

Full model setup needs a large local or mounted SSD. The reference checkpoint is
`mlx-community/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit`, with 33 safetensors shards totaling about
141 GiB. `setup.sh` downloads the checkpoint from the fast Darkbloom/R2 mirror by
default into a repo-local Hugging Face-style cache under
`.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit/snapshots/main/`.
It verifies cached files against `fixtures/reference_deepseek_v4_flash_4bit.sha256`
and redownloads only files that are missing, truncated, or hash-mismatched. A
compatibility symlink is created at `reference_weights/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit`
for older commands, but current setup and CI pass the canonical cache directory
to transform explicitly. The downloader uses resumable `curl` requests, prints
numbered shard progress with elapsed time, and checks for at least 170 GiB free
by default. After a full SHA-256 verification, setup writes
`.mlxfast-reference-cache.lock` next to the checkpoint; later setup runs use
cheap size/mtime checks against that lock and skip the full 141 GiB hash pass
when the cache is unchanged. Use
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_CACHE_DIR=/Volumes/ssd/hf-cache/.../snapshots/main` or
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR=/Volumes/ssd/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit` to point at a larger
volume, or `MLXFAST_SKIP_WEIGHTS_DOWNLOAD=1 ./setup.sh` when the checkpoint will
be supplied separately. If you use a custom cache path, either copy the exact
transform command printed by `setup.sh` or set `MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR` before
running `transform` or `benchmark.sh`. The Swift CLI also honors
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR`, `MLXFAST_WEIGHTS_PATH`,
`MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH`, and `MLXFAST_SCORE_PATH` as defaults;
explicit CLI flags take precedence. For `benchmark.sh`, use those `MLXFAST_*`
environment variables for path overrides; pass `--weights`, `--golden`, and
`--score-path` only to `.build/release/mlxfast-swift benchmark` directly. Set
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_BASE_URL` to use
another HTTP checkpoint prefix, including Hugging Face. Run `./setup.sh --help`
for the full local setup knobs.

For manual GitHub Actions benchmark runs, dispatch `benchmark.yml` on the
trusted repository workflow. The workflow uses the protected
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_BASE_URL` secret when present, otherwise the fixed Darkbloom
reference mirror. It downloads the reference checkpoint into the same
repo-local Hugging Face-style cache path used by local setup, passes that path
explicitly to the offline transform, then prepares the correctness golden after
transform completes. Correctness-only workflow runs use the checked-in public
`correctness_prompts/public_longcopy_gate_english_512_256.json` fixture. Full
benchmark runs require the precomputed hidden R2 object
`correctness_prompts/golden_prompt_benchmark_transcription_gate_english_512_256.json`.
Full benchmark runs also require the private R2
`correctness_prompts/gpqa_reference_cases.json` object. The workflow tokenizes
5 token-budget-valid hidden GPQA multiple-choice prompts locally and attaches
them as short-answer behavior gates before correctness runs. Each private GPQA
case must include precomputed reference `accepted_token_sequences` or
`accepted_responses`; GPQA answer keys are metadata, not an exact-token oracle,
and the benchmark workflow never regenerates this reference object.
The official workflow checks the first generated GPQA answer token for each
case, using the stable prefix of any longer precomputed reference sequence.
During that hidden behavior correctness pass, it also records TTFT by timing
prompt prefill through the first greedy answer token. The uploaded score records
only aggregate TTFT counts and timings; generated first-token IDs, accepted
token IDs, prompts, and answers stay out of GitHub logs and artifacts.
The same correctness pass captures short hidden GPQA continuations and sends
only those private answer bundles to Claude for a semantic pass/fail judge. This
requires the `ORG_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret. The score artifact records
only aggregate semantic counts and the judge model name; prompts, references,
candidate answers, and judge text stay in the private runner directory.
The private workflow treats semantic GPQA as a hard gate with a 3/5 threshold,
calibrated to the unmodified DeepSeek V4 Flash baseline rather than to
better-than-baseline GPQA answer quality.
If none of those is configured, a full benchmark fails; it will not use a
committed prompt, committed golden, or Actions cache fallback for ranked
scoring. Final hidden goldens should come from protected storage. Private
endpoints can pass headers through
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_AUTH_HEADER` and `MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_AUTH_HEADER`
repository secrets. Private R2 golden downloads use the `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
`R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT`, and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secrets. See
[`docs/private-benchmark-security.md`](docs/private-benchmark-security.md) for
the private prompt and artifact handling model.

## Why this challenge exists

DeepSeek V4 Flash has 256 routed experts per layer, 6 activated per token.
The checkpoint is too large to keep fully resident on typical Apple Silicon
machines. The baseline ships with SSD streaming: expert tensors stay on disk and
only the routed tensors needed for the current forward pass are materialized.

That baseline is functional but naive. Expert reads block the forward pass,
there is no prefetching, no cross-layer reuse, and the weights are stored in
their original 4-bit form. Every one of these is an optimisation target.
The generated `weights/` tree is expected to stay small: it is a runtime
artifact overlay on top of the frozen reference checkpoint, not a second full
model copy. Submissions may change both the Swift transform and Swift runtime
to adjust metadata, caching, or streaming strategy, as long as the generated
runnable artifacts pass the hidden correctness and benchmark checks.

## The modifiable surface

Unlike typical inference benchmarks, the entire model execution pipeline is
in scope. Submissions should focus on the Swift targets listed in
`benchmark.json`:

| Path | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `Sources/MLXFastModel/` | DeepSeek V4 Flash runtime, MLX Swift array bridge, dense/expert loading, SSD streaming, decode/prefill logic. **Primary target.** |
| `Sources/MLXFastTransform/` | Offline weight transform from frozen reference safetensors into benchmark-ready `weights/`. |

The repository is Swift-only: setup, transform, correctness, and benchmark all
run through the Swift package. Correctness, scoring, timing, and provenance are
trusted harness code outside `editablePaths`; only the model and transform
targets are contestant-editable.

Submissions are made with the **Yukon CLI (`mlxfast`)**, a separate tool that
manages your account and uploads across all Yukon benchmarks. The
`mlxfast-swift` binary runs the benchmark domain only (transform, correctness,
benchmark, preflight, verify-transform) and no longer logs in or uploads.

```bash
mlxfast login <api-key> --api https://yukon-api.fly.dev
mlxfast clone <benchmark-id-or-name>     # fresh checkout; an existing repo auto-links by its git remote
mlxfast submit --model "Claude Opus 4.8" \
  --note "Changed expert streaming prefetch policy."
mlxfast submissions
```

`mlxfast submit` reads `benchmark.json` and uploads only the paths listed in
`editablePaths` as `submission.tar.gz`, POSTed to Yukon with
`Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` and an idempotency key. Generated `weights/`,
reference checkpoints, golden files, and local scores live outside
`editablePaths` and are never uploaded; the backend re-enforces the editable
surface server-side after upload. `--model` is required and is recorded for the
leaderboard. `MLXFAST_API_URL` / `MLXFAST_API_TOKEN` (or the `YUKON_*`
equivalents) configure the endpoint and token for scripted runs.
Before uploading, Yukon runs the contract `preSubmitCommand`, which is
`./benchmark.sh --local-submit` for this benchmark. That local-submit pass is
the local submit gate: it uses the public/local oracle, writes and prints
`score.json`, and stops obviously broken or slower changes before they spend
official runner time.

## Local Commands

Use these two benchmark modes for local development:

| Command | Purpose | What it checks | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `./benchmark.sh --local-iterate` | Fast edit-loop signal, usually under 2 minutes after setup. | Public 512-token prompt, prefill next-token check, and 16 teacher-forced decode checks. | `score.local-iterate.json` with `score: null`. |
| `./benchmark.sh --local-submit` | Yukon pre-submit gate, intended to be about 10 minutes after setup. | Same public prompt, prefill next-token check, and 1023 teacher-forced decode checks from a longer public fixture. | `score.json` with `score: null`. |

Neither local mode produces an official leaderboard score. Official ranking
still runs the hidden benchmark oracle and hidden correctness gates on the
trusted runner.

## Scoring

```
decode_speedup = baseline_decode_sec_per_token / decode_sec_per_token
prefill_speedup = baseline_prefill_sec_per_token / prefill_sec_per_token
score = decode_speedup^0.75 * prefill_speedup^0.25
```

Higher score is better. A baseline implementation on the official runner scores
about `1.0`; improvements should move the score upward. Decode is weighted more
heavily because it dominates interactive generation, while prefill still matters
for prompt processing.
Both phases must also stay within 5% of the official baseline:

```
decode_speedup >= 0.95
prefill_speedup >= 0.95
```

The floor prevents a submission from sacrificing one serving phase badly to
improve the other. The exact baseline timings are emitted in each `score.json`
and kept in `MLXFastConstants` after trusted Blacksmith calibration.
On the current Blacksmith M4 baseline, that means decode must be at most
`4.442638496439145` seconds/token and prefill must be at most
`0.18242698079358555` seconds/token.
For scoring, decode is trusted parent wall-clock time for decode setup plus the
checked decode-token window, not worker-reported per-step time. That charges
prompt-specific seed prefill to the decode phase so submitted model code cannot
hide speculative decode work before the timer starts.
The harness records `bandwidth_source=trusted_core_expert_slot_bank_reads` and
derives `bandwidth_gb_per_token` from trusted-core expert slot-bank file bytes
during the decode window. Bandwidth, RAM, and expert-read metrics are reported
for operator review and future guardrails; they are not primary score factors.
Correctness is a hard gate. See CHALLENGE.md for the full correctness specification.
The official run times the benchmark before correctness so the correctness gate
cannot warm the measured model path. It then checks 64 public correctness
positions plus the hidden GPQA behavior checks.
Public local correctness uses the checked-in correctness fixture. When a local
edit-loop signal is enough, `--local-iterate` uses that public 512-token prompt,
checks the prefill next token plus 16 teacher-forced decode tokens, writes
`score.local-iterate.json`, prints it, and leaves `score` null because it is not
a ranked benchmark score. The submit hook `--local-submit` uses the same public
prompt with a longer 1024-token fixture: it checks the prefill next token plus
1023 teacher-forced decode tokens in one continuous trajectory, writes
`score.json`, and also leaves `score` null because official ranking still
requires the hidden benchmark oracle on the trusted runner.
The score payload includes the official baseline timings, computed speedups,
wall-clock phase timings, final process RSS, expert streaming counters, and
transformed-weights digest.

## Architecture

```
Sources/
  MLXFastCLI/                Swift command-line entrypoint
  MLXFastCore/               score.json, golden cases, shared contracts
  MLXFastTransform/          Swift offline weight transform
  MLXFastModel/              editable DeepSeek V4 Flash Swift runtime
  MLXFastHarness/            trusted correctness, golden, and benchmark runner
weights/                     transformed weights (harness loads from here)
  experts/
    manifest.json            baseline byte ranges for streamed expert tensors
.cache/huggingface/hub/...   canonical frozen 4-bit reference checkpoint cache
reference_weights/...        compatibility symlink to the reference cache
correctness_prompts/         public correctness prompt and checked-in golden
correctness_golden.json      hidden benchmark correctness cases and token oracle
score.json                   written after each benchmark run
```

The baseline runtime loads dense/shared tensors from `weights/` and streams
routed expert tensors from the frozen reference checkpoint named by
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR`, falling back to the compatibility symlink when that
environment variable is not set.

The standard preflight/benchmark path enforces a default 25 GiB cap on the
generated `weights/` tree before correctness or timing runs. Change it with
`MLXFAST_MAX_WEIGHTS_BYTES`; use `0`, `none`, or `unlimited` only for organizer
debugging. For stricter organizer-side provenance, set
`MLXFAST_VERIFY_TRANSFORM=1` when running `benchmark.sh`. That re-runs the
submitted Swift transform into a clean temporary directory and fails unless
`weights/` is byte-equal to that fresh run. This checks determinism and stale
files; it does not require the baseline `weights/` layout. `verify-transform`
uses the same default cap and can also be changed with
`mlxfast-swift verify-transform --max-bytes N`.

The public correctness-only prompt and golden live in `correctness_prompts/`.
Private prompt manifests and hidden benchmark golden files are not committed or
generated by the benchmark workflow. In private benchmark CI, the normal path
downloads the precomputed
`correctness_prompts/golden_prompt_benchmark_transcription_gate_english_512_256.json`
object from R2, then downloads
`correctness_prompts/gpqa_reference_cases.json` and merges it into the local
golden as 5 hidden GPQA behavior checks. Generate
final hidden benchmark goldens outside the public repository and upload the
resulting file to the protected private R2 path. The benchmark workflow stores
its local golden copy under `$RUNNER_TEMP`, not the repository workspace, and
uploads only hash and byte-count sidecars. The semantic GPQA answer and judge
result files are also kept under the private runner directory and are not
uploaded.

The Swift `make-golden` generator has been removed from the public harness so CI
only consumes precomputed fixtures. The last commit on this branch containing
that generator is `bcc9438fabf95a9b371d5749dd64f2f5ccc60fd5`.

Each base correctness prompt must contain exactly 512 token IDs. The benchmark
prompt must contain at least 512 token IDs. The precomputed golden file stores
exact expected tokens for each 512-token correctness prompt continuation, the
512-token prefill check, the 512-token decode seed, and at least 128 tokens for
the timed decode window. During correctness, the harness checks the first 64
public continuation positions by default, plus hidden
behavior gates in official benchmark runs. It checks those continuation
positions teacher-forced: after each accepted step it feeds the
golden previous token back into the model. This keeps the gate stable across
Apple GPU/software differences by preventing one earlier mismatch from
cascading into unrelated later-token failures. A token is accepted only when it
matches the expected token, except for a true top-logit tie within the tiny
`1e-6` logit tolerance used by the harness.

Private fixtures can also include a `correctness_gates` object with hidden
anchor logits, short free-run prefixes, and answer-token behavior checks.
Those gates are additive: public local correctness still works with the
checked-in fixture, while official benchmark fixtures can cover more adversarial
behavior without exposing prompt or answer data. Behavior checks compare
accepted answer prefixes against up to `max_new_tokens` generated tokens, which
lets hidden GPQA questions require only a one-letter answer while tolerating
tokenizer whitespace variants.
