# mlxfast — DeepSeek V4 Flash Swift Challenge

Optimize DeepSeek V4 Flash inference on Apple Silicon while preserving exact
greedy output for the supplied correctness prompts.

## Contract

Submissions are evaluated through the Swift harness:

```bash
./setup.sh
./benchmark.sh
```

The benchmark entrypoint:

1. Builds `mlxfast-swift` when needed.
2. Runs the Swift transform if `weights/` is missing or `MLXFAST_FORCE_TRANSFORM=1`.
3. Runs the correctness gate against `correctness_golden.json`.
4. Validates the benchmark prefill/decode tokens against the hidden benchmark
   oracle in `correctness_golden.json`.
5. Measures prefill latency, 256-step greedy decode latency, MLX peak memory, and
   expert-streaming read-byte diagnostics.
6. Writes `score.json` in the Darkbloom-compatible schema, plus
   `score.json.sha256` and `benchmark-integrity.json` audit sidecars.

If required artifacts are missing, the harness writes a failed `score.json`
rather than producing a ranked score.

After transform, local users can run the checked-in public correctness gate with
`.build/release/mlxfast-swift correctness --weights weights`. For benchmark
iteration, `./benchmark.sh --quick` requires a local golden file that includes
the benchmark oracle; it checks only the first 64 correctness tokens and times
only 64 decode tokens. It still writes and prints `score.json`; it is a
directional local signal, not the official ranking run.

## Model Artifacts

By default, `setup.sh` stores the frozen reference checkpoint in a repo-local
Hugging Face-style cache:

```text
.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit/snapshots/main/
```

It also creates this compatibility symlink unless the path already exists:

```text
reference_weights/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit/
```

By default `setup.sh` downloads `mlx-community/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit` from the
configured mirror with resumable `curl` requests. It checks cached files against
the pinned SHA256 manifest and redownloads only missing, truncated, or
hash-mismatched files. The safetensors payload is about 141 GiB across 33
shards; `setup.sh` requires 170 GiB free by default before starting. After a
full verification, setup writes `.mlxfast-reference-cache.lock`; later setup
runs use cheap size/mtime checks from that lock and skip the full checkpoint
hash pass when the cache is unchanged. Set
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_CACHE_DIR` or `MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR` to a larger local or
mounted SSD when the repo disk is too small, or set
`MLXFAST_SKIP_WEIGHTS_DOWNLOAD=1` when the checkpoint is provisioned externally.

The Swift transform writes benchmark-ready weights here:

```text
weights/
  config.json
  model.safetensors.index.json
  experts/manifest.json
```

The generated `weights/` tree is a compact runtime artifact set, not a second
full copy of the checkpoint. It stores dense/shared tensors plus metadata, while
the baseline runtime streams routed expert tensors from the frozen reference
checkpoint. Submissions may adjust this overlay by changing both
`Sources/MLXFastTransform/` and `Sources/MLXFastModel/`; correctness and
benchmark results are the authority, not byte equality with the baseline
layout.

The public correctness-only prompt and golden are committed under
`correctness_prompts/` so participants can run a local correctness smoke test.
The timed benchmark token oracle is supplied by the benchmark operator and is
intentionally not committed to the public repo:

```text
correctness_golden.json
```

Use `MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH=/path/to/correctness_golden.json` when the
file is provisioned outside the repository root.
Benchmark CI consumes the checked-in public golden for correctness-only runs and
downloads the private precomputed golden from protected storage for full
benchmark runs. Private prompt manifests and hidden benchmark goldens are not
committed to the public repository. The workflow does not generate goldens;
organizers regenerate them offline and upload the resulting file to protected
storage.

## Editable Surface

The active editable surface is Swift-only and is defined by `benchmark.json`:

| Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `Sources/MLXFastModel/` | DeepSeek V4 Flash model implementation: attention, MoE, expert streaming, caches, weight loading, and prefill/decode execution. |
| `Sources/MLXFastTransform/` | Offline safetensors transform and expert manifest generation. |

`Sources/MLXFastCore/`, `Sources/MLXFastHarness/`,
`Sources/MLXFastCLI/`, scripts, tests, `benchmark.json`, generated
`weights/`, reference checkpoints, golden fixtures, and local scores are
harness/operator files, not submission surface. Correctness, scoring, timing,
golden generation, benchmark-oracle validation, and provenance checks live in
that trusted harness layer.

Account and submission management — login, clone, submit, and listing
submissions — are handled by the **Yukon CLI (`mlxfast`)**, not by
`mlxfast-swift`. The Swift binary now runs the benchmark domain only (transform,
correctness, benchmark, preflight, verify-transform); it no longer logs in or
uploads. Submit with:

```bash
mlxfast login <api-key> --api <url>
mlxfast clone <benchmark-id-or-name>     # fresh checkout; an existing repo auto-links by its git remote
mlxfast submit --model "<model name>" --note "..."
mlxfast submissions
```

`mlxfast submit` reads `benchmark.json` and uploads only `editablePaths` as a
gzip tar archive with bearer-token auth; the backend applies it to the frozen
benchmark checkout and re-enforces the editable surface server-side before
running hidden validation. `--model` is required and is recorded for the
leaderboard; pass `--note-file PATH` or `--claimed-score N` as needed.

`mlxfast-swift verify-transform` is an organizer/debug check for deterministic
transform output. It re-runs the submitted transform and compares the generated
`weights/` tree against that fresh run. It is not a baseline-layout requirement.
The normal preflight/benchmark path also rejects generated `weights/` above the
default 10 GiB transformed-output cap before correctness or timing runs.
Override it with `MLXFAST_MAX_WEIGHTS_BYTES`; `verify-transform` additionally
accepts `--max-bytes`.

There is no Python harness path.

## Correctness Gate

Correctness is a hard gate. Each base golden case contains exactly 512 prompt
token IDs and 256 expected continuation token IDs. The harness checks those
continuation positions teacher-forced with temperature-zero behavior: after each
accepted step it feeds the golden previous token back into the model. The first
mismatch records only the case, step, expected token, and actual token in the
failed report.

The gate is intended as a first-stage filter: an implementation that fails it is
not eligible for the longer benchmark.

Private golden fixtures may add hidden `correctness_gates` on top of the base
teacher-forced cases:

- `anchors`: one-token checks at selected hidden contexts. These can require an
  exact expected token, explicit accepted tokens, or a bounded top-logit rank
  and delta for near-tie hardware cases.
- `free_run`: short greedy continuations whose exact prefix must match. These
  catch bugs that only appear when the model consumes its own generated tokens.
- `behavior`: GPQA-style or instruction-following prompts whose answer is
  checked exactly against precomputed accepted answer token sequences. Each
  accepted answer sequence must have exactly `max_new_tokens` tokens.

Full benchmark CI adds one more private layer after timing: it generates short
answers for hidden GPQA cases and asks a Claude judge whether each candidate is
semantically equivalent to the private reference answer. That semantic gate is
pass/fail only and does not affect the timing score. The uploaded score records
only aggregate semantic counts and the judge model name.

The same hidden GPQA cases are also used for a TTFT guardrail: during the
hidden behavior correctness pass, the workflow times prompt prefill through
the first greedy answer token and verifies that the first token is accepted for
that case. The uploaded score records only
aggregate TTFT pass counts and timing statistics; first-token values and
accepted token sets are not logged or artifacted.

These layers keep the official gate mostly deterministic and token-based while
adding a small semantic backstop against implementations that pass the exact
prefix but damage answer meaning. The benchmark operator should keep private
prompts, accepted answer sequences, reference answers, and judge transcripts
outside the public repository.

The gate intentionally does not port the earlier Python hidden-state comparison
layer. The benchmark contract cares about the externally observable text-to-text
DeepSeek V4 Flash output path, and hidden-state tensors are easier to make
ambiguous around normalization/head-combination than token-level or logit-anchor
checks.

VLM/image inputs and speculative/MTP draft decoding are also out of scope for
this challenge. They should only be added if the official benchmark contract
changes to score those paths.

The hidden golden file also includes a benchmark oracle. The benchmark validates
the greedy token after the fixed 512-token prefill prompt, the greedy token
after the fixed 512-token decode seed, and all 256 tokens produced inside the
timed decode window before accepting a score.

## Score

```text
decode_speedup = baseline_decode_sec_per_token / decode_sec_per_token
prefill_speedup = baseline_prefill_sec_per_token / prefill_sec_per_token
score = decode_speedup^0.75 * prefill_speedup^0.25
```

Higher is better. A baseline implementation on the official runner scores about
`1.0`. Decode is weighted more heavily because it dominates interactive
generation, while prefill still contributes to the ranked score.
The official run also enforces component floors:

```text
decode_speedup >= 0.95
prefill_speedup >= 0.95
```

With the current Blacksmith M4 baseline, those floors allow at most
`3.177180971604` seconds/token for decode and `0.149183255724` seconds/token for
prefill. A run below either floor fails eligibility even if the weighted score
would otherwise be above baseline.

`bandwidth_GB_per_token` is derived from measured expert-streaming file bytes
during the decode window and is reported with
`bandwidth_source=expert_streaming_reads`. Bandwidth, RAM, and expert-read
metrics are diagnostics and guardrail candidates, not primary score factors.
`score.json` also carries audit-only wall-clock phase timings, final process RSS,
expert streaming counters, and transformed-weights digest fields. These values
help operators review runs but do not change the score formula.
