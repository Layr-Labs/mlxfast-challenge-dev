# mlxfast — Gemma 4 31B 4-bit Swift Challenge

Optimize Gemma 4 31B (dense, text tower, 4-bit) inference on Apple Silicon
while preserving exact greedy output for the supplied correctness prompts.

## Contract

Submissions are evaluated through the Swift harness:

```bash
./setup.sh
./benchmark.sh --official
```

(`--official` requires the organizer-provisioned hidden oracle; a bare
`./benchmark.sh` defaults to the public `--local-iterate` mode.)

The benchmark entrypoint:

1. Builds `mlxfast-swift` when needed.
2. Runs the Swift transform if `weights/` is missing or `MLXFAST_FORCE_TRANSFORM=1`.
3. Runs the correctness gate against `correctness_golden.json`.
4. Validates the benchmark prefill/decode tokens against the hidden benchmark
   oracle in `correctness_golden.json`.
5. Measures prefill latency, 128-token checked decode latency, and MLX peak
   memory.
6. Writes `score.json` in the Darkbloom-compatible schema, plus
   `score.json.sha256` and `benchmark-integrity.json` audit sidecars.

If required artifacts are missing, the harness writes a failed `score.json`
rather than producing a ranked score.

After transform, local users can run the checked-in public correctness gate with
`.build/release/mlxfast-swift correctness --weights weights`. For benchmark
iteration, `./benchmark.sh --local-iterate` uses that public 512-token prompt,
checks the prefill next token plus 16 teacher-forced decode tokens, and writes
the measured 512-token prefill and 16 one-token decode timings to
`score.local-iterate.json`. It prints that file with `score: null` because it is
a directional edit-loop signal, not a ranked score.
For submit-loop iteration, `./benchmark.sh --local-submit` uses the same public
512-token prompt as a longer pre-submit benchmark. It checks the prefill next
token plus 1023 teacher-forced decode tokens from a longer public fixture, and
still writes and prints `score.json` with `score: null`; it is a directional
local signal, not the official ranking run.

## Model Artifacts

By default, `setup.sh` stores the frozen reference checkpoint in a repo-local
Hugging Face-style cache:

```text
.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--gemma-4-31b-4bit/snapshots/main/
```

It also creates this compatibility symlink unless the path already exists:

```text
reference_weights/gemma-4-31b-4bit/
```

By default `setup.sh` downloads the `mlx-community/gemma-4-31b-4bit` checkpoint
from the Darkbloom R2 mirror (Hugging Face is available as an override via
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_BASE_URL`) with resumable `curl` requests. It checks cached files against
the pinned SHA256 manifest and redownloads only missing, truncated, or
hash-mismatched files. The safetensors payload is about 18.4 GB across 4
shards; `setup.sh` requires 40 GiB free by default before starting. After a
full verification, setup writes `.mlxfast-reference-cache.lock`; later setup
runs use cheap size/mtime checks from that lock and skip the full checkpoint
hash pass when the cache is unchanged. Set
`MLXFAST_REFERENCE_CACHE_DIR` or `MLXFAST_REFERENCE_DIR` to a different local or
mounted volume when needed, or set
`MLXFAST_SKIP_WEIGHTS_DOWNLOAD=1` when the checkpoint is provisioned externally.

The Swift transform writes benchmark-ready weights here:

```text
weights/
  config.json
  model.safetensors.index.json
  model-0000N-of-0000M.safetensors
  tokenizer.json
  tokenizer_config.json
```

The generated `weights/` tree is a compact runtime artifact set, not a second
full copy of the checkpoint: it holds only the text-tower tensors (the
`language_model.` prefix in the source checkpoint), with every
vision/audio/multimodal-projector tensor dropped, plus a runtime-authored
`config.json` (the flattened Gemma 4 `text_config` fields the runtime needs,
plus the checkpoint's quantization metadata). There is no expert manifest --
the whole model is one flat set of dense tensors loaded fully into RAM at
init; there is no weight streaming of any kind. Submissions may adjust this
overlay by changing both `Sources/MLXFastTransform/` and
`Sources/MLXFastModel/`; correctness and benchmark results are the authority,
not byte equality with the baseline layout.

The public correctness-only prompt and golden are committed under
`correctness_prompts/` so participants can run a local correctness smoke test
(Gemma-generated; see the fixture note above). The timed benchmark token oracle
is supplied by the benchmark operator and is intentionally not committed to
the public repo:

```text
correctness_golden.json
```

Use `MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH=/path/to/correctness_golden.json` when the
file is provisioned outside the repository root.
Benchmark CI consumes the checked-in public golden for correctness-only runs and
downloads the private precomputed golden from protected storage for full
benchmark runs. Private prompt manifests and hidden benchmark goldens are not
committed to the public repository. The workflow does not generate goldens;
organizers regenerate them offline and upload the resulting file to protected
storage.

## Editable Surface

The active editable surface is Swift-only and is defined by `benchmark.json`:

| Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `Sources/MLXFastModel/` | Gemma 4 31B 4-bit model implementation: attention (sliding-window + full, GQA, partial-rotary RoPE), gated MLP, RMSNorm, KV caches, dense weight loading, and prefill/decode execution. |
| `Sources/MLXFastTransform/` | Offline safetensors transform (text-tensor selection, config/tokenizer emission). |

`Sources/MLXFastCore/`, `Sources/MLXFastHarness/`,
`Sources/MLXFastCLI/`, scripts, tests, `benchmark.json`, generated
`weights/`, reference checkpoints, golden fixtures, and local scores are
harness/operator files, not submission surface. Correctness, scoring, timing,
golden generation, benchmark-oracle validation, and provenance checks live in
that trusted harness layer.

Account and submission management — login, clone, submit, and listing
submissions — are handled by the **Yukon CLI (`mlxfast`)**, not by
`mlxfast-swift`. The Swift binary now runs the benchmark domain only (transform,
correctness, benchmark, preflight, verify-transform); it no longer logs in or
uploads. Submit with:

```bash
mlxfast login <api-key> --api <url>
mlxfast clone <benchmark-id-or-name>     # fresh checkout; an existing repo auto-links by its git remote
mlxfast submit --model "<model name>" --note "..."
mlxfast submissions
```

`mlxfast submit` reads `benchmark.json` and uploads only `editablePaths` as a
gzip tar archive with bearer-token auth; the backend applies it to the frozen
benchmark checkout and re-enforces the editable surface server-side before
running hidden validation. `--model` is required and is recorded for the
leaderboard; pass `--note-file PATH` or `--claimed-score N` as needed.
The benchmark contract also declares a local `preSubmitCommand`:
`./benchmark.sh --local-submit`. Yukon runs that command before upload so
participants get a roughly 10-minute local correctness and timing check during
the submit loop without running the full official hidden benchmark.

`mlxfast-swift verify-transform` is an organizer/debug check for deterministic
transform output. It re-runs the submitted transform and compares the generated
`weights/` tree against that fresh run. It is not a baseline-layout requirement.
The normal preflight/benchmark path also rejects generated `weights/` above the
default 25 GiB transformed-output cap before correctness or timing runs (the
text tower is about 17 GB, comfortably under that cap).
Override it with `MLXFAST_MAX_WEIGHTS_BYTES`; `verify-transform` additionally
accepts `--max-bytes`.

There is no Python harness path.

## Correctness Gate

Correctness is a hard gate. Each base golden case contains exactly 512 prompt
token IDs and at least 64 expected continuation token IDs. The harness checks
the first 64 continuation positions teacher-forced with temperature-zero
behavior: after each accepted step it feeds the golden previous token back into
the model. The first mismatch records only the case, step, expected token, and
actual token in the failed report.

The gate is intended as a first-stage filter: an implementation that fails it is
not eligible for the longer benchmark.

Private golden fixtures may add hidden `correctness_gates` on top of the base
teacher-forced cases:

- `anchors`: one-token checks at selected hidden contexts. These can require an
  exact expected token, explicit accepted tokens, or a bounded top-logit rank
  and delta for near-tie hardware cases.
- `free_run`: short greedy continuations whose exact prefix must match. These
  catch bugs that only appear when the model consumes its own generated tokens.
- `behavior`: GPQA-style or instruction-following prompts whose answer is
  checked exactly against precomputed accepted answer token sequences. Each
  accepted answer sequence must have at most `max_new_tokens` tokens; shorter
  sequences are matched as exact prefixes of the generated answer.

Full benchmark CI adds one more private layer after timing: it generates short
answers for hidden GPQA cases and asks a Claude judge whether each candidate is
semantically equivalent to the private reference answer. That semantic gate is
pass/fail only and does not affect the timing score. The uploaded score records
only aggregate semantic counts and the judge model name.

The same hidden GPQA cases are also used for a TTFT guardrail: during the
hidden behavior correctness pass, the workflow times prompt prefill through
the first greedy answer token and verifies that the first token is accepted for
that case. The uploaded score records only
aggregate TTFT pass counts and timing statistics; first-token values and
accepted token sets are not logged or artifacted.

These layers keep the official gate mostly deterministic and token-based while
adding a small semantic backstop against implementations that pass the exact
prefix but damage answer meaning. The benchmark operator should keep private
prompts, accepted answer sequences, reference answers, and judge transcripts
outside the public repository.

The gate intentionally does not port a hidden-state comparison layer. The
benchmark contract cares about the externally observable text-to-text Gemma 4
output path, and hidden-state tensors are easier to make ambiguous around
normalization/softcapping than token-level or logit-anchor checks.

VLM/image inputs, audio inputs, and speculative/MTP draft decoding are also
out of scope for this challenge. Only the Gemma 4 text tower is in scope; the
vision tower is never loaded or executed. These should only be added if the
official benchmark contract changes to score those paths.

The hidden golden file also includes a benchmark oracle. The benchmark validates
the greedy token after the fixed 512-token prefill prompt, the greedy token
after the fixed 512-token decode seed, and all 128 tokens produced inside the
timed decode window before accepting a score.

## Score

```text
decode_speedup = baseline_decode_sec_per_token / decode_sec_per_token
prefill_speedup = baseline_prefill_sec_per_token / prefill_sec_per_token
score = decode_speedup^0.75 * prefill_speedup^0.25
```

Higher is better. A baseline implementation on the official runner scores about
`1.0`. Decode is weighted more heavily because it dominates interactive
generation, while prefill still contributes to the ranked score.
The official run also enforces component floors:

```text
decode_speedup >= 0.95
prefill_speedup >= 0.95
```

The baseline constants backing these floors (`MLXFastConstants.officialBaseline*`)
are calibrated against the unmodified Gemma 4 31B 4-bit reference
implementation on the ranked runner (tenki-macos-latest-xlarge, cold; see
`docs/benchmark-window-freeze.md` for the measurement provenance). On official
runs the paired-baseline (same-session measured reference) and per-prompt
golden baseline paths -- both of which take precedence over the constants in
the benchmark harness -- price the floors against a live same-session sample.
A run below either floor fails eligibility even if the weighted score would
otherwise be above baseline. On the calibrated constants, those floors allow
at most `0.18894500280921053` seconds/token for decode and
`0.04073888044860198` seconds/token for prefill.

The whole model is RAM-resident with no weight streaming, so
`bandwidth_gb_per_token` is always `0`, reported with
`bandwidth_source=ram_resident_model`. RAM and phase-timing metrics are
diagnostics and guardrail candidates, not primary score factors.
`score.json` also carries audit-only wall-clock phase timings, final process RSS,
zeroed expert-streaming counters (kept for score-schema stability), and
transformed-weights digest fields. These values help operators review runs but
do not change the score formula.
